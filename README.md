### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I feel that lab 3 especially was helpful in preparing em for this lab. I basically copied and pasted most of the functons from that lab into here and changed some of the logic in order to achieve the desired outputs.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time I definitely would have wanted to work on implenting a functional pop up feature where it would show the description of the movie.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

For one of the project demo presentations, one of my peers actually included the overview of the movie in their movie card and I thought that was really creative. This inspired be to want to have a funcitoning pop up feature that would display above the movie card itself.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
